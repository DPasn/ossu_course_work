I began the OSSU curriculum on December 5th, 2020.

This repository will hold programs and other artifacts from my studies in courses based on OSSU recommendations. I primarily plan to follow the computer science curriculum, but will supplement with some courses from the data science curriculum.

This repository was started at the end of the python for everybody course, so materials begin with MIT's open courseware 6.0001.
